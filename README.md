# My Personal Portfolio (Classwork Project)

## Project Overview

This repository hosts a personal portfolio website, developed as a classwork assignment during my Computer Science studies.The primary goal of this project was to apply foundational frontend web development skills, specifically focusing on HTML5 and CSS3, to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing online presence.

This portfolio serves as a demonstration of my current abilities in web design and development, showcasing my core skills and providing a glimpse into my learning journey.

## Design Philosophy: Professional Pastel

The design of this portfolio aims for a "professional pastel" aesthetic. It combines soft, inviting pastel color schemes with clean layouts and clear typography to create an approachable yet polished user experience. The intention was to strike a balance between a friendly, modern look and a professional presentation suitable for showcasing technical skills.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** Adapts gracefully to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
* **About Me/Hero Section:** Introduces me and my primary focus.
* **Skills Showcase:** Highlights key technical competencies with clear, concise descriptions.
* **Social Media Integration:** Links to relevant online profiles using Font Awesome icons.
* **Clean & Intuitive Navigation:** Easy-to-use menu for seamless Browse.
* **Subtle Hover Effects:** Enhances user interaction without being distracting.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.
* **CSS3:** For styling and layout, including flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive design.
* **Font Awesome:** Utilized for a wide range of scalable vector icons (social media, skill icons).
* **Google Fonts:** Used for custom typography (`Quicksand` for headings and `Open Sans` for body text) to enhance readability and aesthetics.

## Learning & Development

This project was a valuable learning experience, allowing me to deepen my understanding of:

* Semantic HTML structure.
* Advanced CSS properties, including `flexbox`, `grid`, `transitions`, and `box-shadow` for visual effects.
* Responsive web design principles using media queries.
* Integrating external libraries like Font Awesome and Google Fonts.
* Applying a cohesive design theme (pastel aesthetics) throughout a project.

I appreciate the guidance and resources that helped shape this project into its current form, contributing to a more refined and functional outcome.
